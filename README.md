# pico-infonesPlus.

## Introduction


A NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator with SD card and menu support for the Raspberry Pi Pico, Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and other RP2040/RP2350 based microcontrollers. Uses HDMI for display. 

Supports two controllers for two player games. [See "about two player games" below for specifics and limitations](#about-two-player-games) 

The emulator used is  [Infones by Jay Kumogata](https://github.com/jay-kumogata/InfoNES) which was ported to the [Raspberry Pi Pico by Shuichi Takano](https://github.com/shuichitakano/pico-infones) with changes done by me to accomodate the SD card menu.

Create a FAT32 formatted SD card and copy your NES roms on to it. It is possible to organize your roms into different folders. Then insert the SD Card into the card slot. Needless to say you must own all the roms you put on the card.

A menu is added to the emulator, which reads the roms from the SD card and shows them on screen for the user to select,  flash and play.

See below for [possible configurations](#possible-configurations), [supported game controllers](#gamecontroller-support) and how to [setup](#setup).  There is even a custom [PCB (printed circuit board)](#pcb-with-raspberry-pi-pico-or-pico-2) available and a [3D-printable case design](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus#3d-printed-case) which fits the PCB is in the works.

[See also the Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/nes-emulator-for-rp2040-dvi-boards), although it is outdated now. 

There is also an emulator port for the Sega Master System/Sega Game Gear. You can find it here [https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-smsplus](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-smsplus)

## About two player games

The emulator supports two player games using two NES controllers or an USB gamecontroller and a NES controller.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use two USB controllers for two player games.
> At the moment only one USB controller is recognized by the driver. In this case the USB controller is always player 1. Player 2 must be a NES controller.


| | Player 1 | Player 2 |
| --- | -------- | -------- |
| USB controller connected | USB | NES port 1 or NES port 2 |
| No usb controller connected | NES port 1| NES port 2 |

## Warning
Repeatedly flashing your Pico will eventually wear out the flash memory. 

The emulator overclocks the Pico in order to get the emulator working fast enough. Overclocking can reduce the Pico's lifespan.

Use this software at your own risk! I will not be responsible in any way for any damage to your Pico and/or connected peripherals caused by using this software.

I also do not take responsability in any way when damage is caused to the Pico or display due to incorrect wiring or voltages.

## Waveshare RP2040-PiZero Development Board

### materials needed

- [Waveshare RP2040-PiZero Development Board](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-pizero.htm).
- [USB-C to USB-C - USB-A Y cable](https://a.co/d/eteMZLt). (when using an USB controller)
- [USB-C to USB-A cable](https://a.co/d/2i7rJid) for flashing the uf2 onto the board.
- USB-C Power supply. Connect to the port labelled USB, not PIO-USB.
- [Mini HDMI to HDMI Cable](https://a.co/d/5BZg3Z6).
- FAT 32 formatted Micro SD card with roms you legally own. Roms must have the .nes extension. You can organise your roms into different folders.

> [!NOTE]
> When using an USB controller, connect the controller and the power adapter to the Y cable. Connect the Y-cable to the port on the board labelled USB. I do not recommend powering the board via the PIO-USB port. This caused some weird behaviour.

#### NES controller port.

When using a original NES controller you need:

- [NES controller port](https://www.zedlabz.com/products/controller-connector-port-for-nintendo-nes-console-7-pin-90-degree-replacement-2-pack-black-zedlabz)
- [An original NES controller](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=NES+controller&crid=1CX7W9NQQDF8H&sprefix=nes+controller%2Caps%2C174&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)
- [Dupont female to female wires](https://a.co/d/cJVmnQO)

For two player games with two NES controllers you need an extra NES controller port, controller and wire


|           | Port 1 | Port 2 (Optional) | Note |
| ------------- | ---- | ----- | ---------- |
| GND           |      | | Any ground pin |
| VCC (Power)   |      | | 5Volt pin         |
| NES Clock     | GPIO5 | GPIO10 |          |
| NES LATCH     | GPIO9 | GPIO11|        |
| NES Data      | GPIO6 | GPIO12|        |

![Image](assets/nes-controller-pinout.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Contrary to other configurations where VCC is connected to 3Volt, VCC should be connected to a 5Volt pin. Otherwise the NES controller could possibly not work.

#### WII-Classic controller.

When using a WII-Classic controller you need:

-  [Adafruit Wii Nunchuck Breakout Adapter - Qwiic / STEMMA QT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4836)
-  [STEMMA QT / Qwiic JST SH 4-pin Cable with Premium Female Sockets](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4397) 
-  [WII Classic wired controller](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wii-classic+controller)

Connections are as follows:

| Nunchuck Breakout Adapter | RP2040-PiZero |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| 3.3V                   | 3V3          |
| GND                    | GND          |
| SDA                    | GPIO2        |
| SCL                    | GPIO3        |

### flashing the Waveshare RP2040-PiZero Development Board

### 3D printed case for PCB

[DynaMight1124](https://github.com/DynaMight1124) is designing a NES-like case you can 3d-print as an enclosure for this pcb.  The design will be released soon.

>[!NOTE]
> The design he created for the previous version of the PCB (v0.2) can be found [here](PCB/v0.2); however, the current PCB does not fit in this design.

# Menu Usage
Gamepad buttons:
- UP/DOWN: Next/previous item in the menu.
- LEFT/RIGHT: next/previous page.
- A (Circle): Open folder/flash and start game.
- B (X): Back to parent folder.
- START: Starts game currently loaded in flash.

# Emulator (in game)
Gamepad buttons:
- SELECT + START: Resets back to the SD Card menu. Game saves are saved to the SD card.
- SELECT + UP/SELECT + DOWN: switches screen modes.
- SELECT + A/B: toggle rapid-fire.
- START + A : Toggle framerate display

***

# Save games
For games which support it, saves will be stored in the /SAVES folder of the SD card. Caution: the save ram will only be saved back to the SD card when quitting the game via (START + SELECT)

***

# Raspberry Pico W support
The emulator works with the Pico W, but without the onboard blinking led. In order for the led to work on the Pico W, the cyw43 driver needs to be initialised. This causes the emulator to stop with an out of memory panic. 

***

# USB game Controllers latency
Using a USB gamecontroller introduces some latency. The legacy controllers ((S)NES, WII-classic) have less latency.

# Troubleshooting no image on TV or monitor

- Make sure the board is directly connected to your display. Do not connect through a HDMI splitter.
- Some displays need 5V in order to work:
  - When using the breadboard with HDMI and SD breakout, make sure VBUS (Pin 40) is connected to the 5 volt via  on the board. (Marked 5 on the side)

***

# Known Issues and limitations
- Pimoroni Pico DV: 
  - Audio through the audio out jack is not supported, audio only works over hdmi.
  - Debug printf statements over UART (GPIO0 and GPIO1) are disabled because GPIO1 is used for second nes controller port.
- Due to the Pico's memory limitations, not all games will work. Games not working will show a "Mapper n is unsupported." (n is a number). For example starting Castlevania III will show the "Mapper 5 is unsupported." message.
- tar file support is removed.
- Pico W: The onboard led does not blink every 60 frames.

***

# Building from source

Best is to use the included build script [buildAll.sh](buildAll.sh). You can then copy the correct .uf2 to your Pico via the bootsel option. The script builds three .uf2 files and puts them in the releases folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus.git
cd pico-infonesPlus
git submodule update --init
chmod +x build*.sh
./buildAll.sh
```

When using Visual Studio code, choose the Release or the RelWithDebuginfo build variant.
