# pico-infonesPlus.

> [A more comprehensive guide from Adafruit can be found here](https://learn.adafruit.com/nes-emulator-for-rp2040-dvi-boards)

A NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator for RP2040 based microcontrollers with SD card and menu support. Uses HDMI for display. 

Supports two controllers dual player mode. [See below for specifics](#about-dual-player-mode) 

> There is also an emulator port for the Sega Master System/Sega Game Gear. You can find it here [https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-smsplus](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-smsplus)

The emulator used is  [Infones by Jay Kumogata](https://github.com/jay-kumogata/InfoNES) which was ported to the [Raspberry Pi Pico by Shuichi Takano](https://github.com/shuichitakano/pico-infones) with changes done by me to accomodate the SD card menu.

In stead of flashing a NES rom to the Pico using picotool, you create a FAT32 formatted SD card and copy your NES roms on to it. It is possible to organize your roms into different folders. Then insert the SD Card into the card slot. Needless to say you must own all the roms you put on the card.

A menu is added to the emulator, which reads the roms from the SD card and shows them on screen for the user to select,  flash and play.

## About dual player mode

The emulator supports dual player mode with two NES controllers or an USB gamecontroller and a NES controller connected on controller port 2. The USB controller is always player 1.

> [!NOTE]
> You can not use two USB controllers for two player mode.
>  At the moment only one USB controller is recognized by the driver.
> The second controller must be a NES controller. In this config the NES controller port must be wired up to the GPIO pins of controller 2. See configurations below.

## Warning
Repeatedly flashing your Pico will eventually wear out the flash memory. 

The emulator overclocks the Pico in order to get the emulator working fast enough. Overclocking can reduce the Pico's lifespan.

Use this software at your own risk! I will not be responsible in any way for any damage to your Pico and/or connected peripherals caused by using this software.

I also do not take responsability in any way when damage is caused to the Pico or display due to incorrect wiring or voltages.

- Drag and drop the UF2 file on to the RPI-RP2 drive. The board will reboot and will now run the emulator.


> Note: When the emulator won't start and the screen shows "No signal", press the run button once again. The emulator will now boot.

## PCB with Raspberry Pi Pico

> Note: Soldering skills are required.

Create your own little Pico Based NES console and play with an orginal (S)NES controller. 
The PCB design files can be found in the [assets/pcb](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/tree/main/assets/pcb) folder. Several Companies  can make these PCBs for you. 

I personally recommend [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/). The boards i ordered from them are of excellent quality.

Simply upload the design files packed as a [zip archive](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/releases/latest) when ordering. A zip file containing the design files can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/releases/latest).

## Menu Usage
Gamepad buttons:
- UP/DOWN: Next/previous item in the menu.
- LEFT/RIGHT: next/previous page.
- A (Circle): Open folder/flash and start game.
- B (X): Back to parent folder.
- START: Starts game currently loaded in flash.

## Emulator (in game)
Gamepad buttons:
- SELECT + START: Resets back to the SD Card menu. Game saves are saved to the SD card.
- SELECT + UP/SELECT + DOWN: switches screen modes.
- SELECT + A/B: toggle rapid-fire.
- START + A : Toggle framerate display

## Save games
For games which support it, saves will be stored in the /SAVES folder of the SD card. Caution: the save ram will only be saved back to the SD card when quitting the game via (START + SELECT)

## Raspberry Pico W support
The emulator works with the Pico W, but without the onboard blinking led. In order for the led to work on the Pico W, the cyw43 driver needs to be initialised. This causes the emulator to stop with an out of memory panic. 

## USB game Controllers latency
Using a USB gamecontroller introduces some latency. The legacy controllers ((S)NES, WII-classic) have less latency.

## Troubleshooting no image on TV or monitor

- Make sure the board is directly connected to your display. Do not connect through a HDMI splitter.
- Some displays need 5V in order to work:
  - When using the breadboard with HDMI and SD breakout, make sure VBUS (Pin 40) is connected to the 5 volt via  on the board. (Marked 5 on the side)

## Known Issues and limitations
- Pimoroni Pico DV: Audio through the audio out jack is not supported, audio only works over hdmi.
- Due to the Pico's memory limitations, not all games will work. Games not working will show a "Mapper n is unsupported." (n is a number). For example starting Castlevania III will show the "Mapper 5 is unsupported." message.
- tar file support is removed.
- Pico W: The onboard led does not blink every 60 frames.

## Building from source

Best is to use the included build script [buildAll.sh](buildAll.sh). You can then copy the correct .uf2 to your Pico via the bootsel option. The script builds three .uf2 files and puts them in the releases folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus.git
cd pico-infonesPlus
git submodule update --init
./buildAll.sh
```

When using Visual Studio code, choose the Release or the Debug build variant.

## Credits
InfoNes is programmed by [Jay Kumogata](https://github.com/jay-kumogata/InfoNES) and ported to the Raspberry Pi Pico by [Shuichi Takano](https://github.com/shuichitakano/pico-infones).

I contributed by adding SD card and menu support. For this reasons I made code changes to the emulator for accommodating the menu and SD card.

NES gamepad support contributed by [PaintYourDragon](https://github.com/PaintYourDragon) & [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit). If using Pimoroni Pico DV Demo Base: NES controller clock, data and latch go to GPIO pins 14, 15 and 16, respectively. If Adafruit DVI Breakout build, it's GPIO pins 6, 7, 8 instead. FeatherDVI  Gamepad should be powered from 3.3V when connected to Pico GPIO, not 5V as usual...seems to work OK regardless.
